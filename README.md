# HTML Elements and Tags Lab 3 - Try it Yourself

## Description 📄
In the “Try It Yourself” lab, you’ll build upon the webpage structure from the previous lab, applying your understanding of HTML in a more independent setting. You’ll add new sections using appropriate header and paragraph tags, and wrap these sections in div elements to create containers for your content. This practice will not only enhance your understanding of HTML but also prepare you for future lessons on CSS. By the end of this lab, you’ll have a more comprehensive webpage and a deeper understanding of how to structure and manipulate webpages using HTML.
